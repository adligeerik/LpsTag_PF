Unknown anchors in measurement
	we need a map in every tag (thus every particle will have one).

	we wont get a measurement from every anchor at all time, this 
	will not be a problem since we only will be using the measurements
	and corresponding anchors.

	All particles will have a calculated list of ddist for all anchors
	regardless if they are used or not.

	If we add an anchor in the system we need to update the map 

	The variance is 20 mm and is assumed to be uncorrelated, that is
	all the ddist are uncorrelated with each other. Thus the Sigma matrix
	is diagonal. If the filter is not as accurate as one might need to 
	reevaluate if the measurements are uncorrelated.

How to find the best (most likely) position of the tag
	Histogram

	Choose the particle with the highest weight

	Calculate the Gauss distribution from all particles (bad if particles
	are not spread out similar as a Gauss)

Re-sampling 
	Use low variance resampling

	To avoid wrongly choose a position, do not re-sample if its not needed.
	That is when we do not have a new measurement or very bad measurement
	Solution is to re-sample when weight_max/weight_min is greater than 
	a threshold, or when var(weights) is greater than a threshold

TODO (sort off)
	Calculate/measure the co-variance of the measurements

	Is the co-variance uncorrelated with all anchors (diagonal matrix) 

	Incorporate the uncertainty of the positions of the anchors in 
	the weight function 

	Remove particles with too small weight and introduce them randomly 
	somewhere else
